**Rule_based_chat_bot_develop**
The Rule-Based Chatbot is a conversational AI system built using predefined rules and pattern-matching logic to simulate human-like interaction. Unlike machine learning-based bots, this chatbot uses a fixed set of rules and keywords to interpret user queries and respond accordingly.

It is designed to handle frequently asked questions (FAQs), perform simple tasks, and provide instant responses without needing complex training data.

ðŸŽ¯ Key Objectives
âœ… Provide quick answers to predefined queries

âœ… Offer a consistent and deterministic conversation experience

âœ… Demonstrate the working of basic NLP rule sets

âœ… Deploy a lightweight chatbot that runs on limited computational resources
